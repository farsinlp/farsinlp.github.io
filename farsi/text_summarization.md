# Text Summarization

Text summarization is the process of shortening a document to a smaller summary that represents the most important information from the original document. Summarization can be either extractive or abstractive.
The former constructs a summary by concatenating extracts taken from the original document whereas the latter involves a generation phase (e.g., paraphrasing) to produce new texts (which are not necessarily from the original document).
